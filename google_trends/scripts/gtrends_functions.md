# **gtrends_functions_verbose** â€“ Developer Guide
Robust Google-Trends downloader with automatic retries, polite throttling and real-time console feedback.

---

## 1 . Overview
`gtrends_functions_verbose.py` wraps **pytrends** with an exponential-back-off retry strategy (powered by **tenacity**) so your script can keep downloading keywords even when Google throws transient *HTTP 429* or network errors.  
A single, reusable `TrendReq` session is shared across the whole run, and the helper prints progress for every batch *and* every keyword so you always know what is happening.
